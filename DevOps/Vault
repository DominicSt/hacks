Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates



If working on multiple environments create aliases:

e.g. 

alias dvault='export VAULT_ADDR=[DEV VAULT HOST ADDRESS] && unset VAULT_TOKEN && vault login -method=ldap username=[USERNAME]'
alias prvault='export VAULT_ADDR=[PROD VAULT HOST ADDRESS] && unset VAULT_TOKEN && vault login -method=ldap username=[USERNAME]'

List secrets:

vault list [PATH]

Read secrets:

vault read [PATH]
vault read -field=value [PATH]

Write secrets:

vault write [PATH] value=[SECRET VALUE]
